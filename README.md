Welcome to the very first locally generated chat using the **GPT-OSS 20B Model**! ðŸŽ‰

This is a demonstration of how the GPT-OSS 20B model can be used to generate natural conversations and create code snippets for various tasks. This project showcases the model's ability to understand user prompts and generate meaningful, contextually appropriate responses.

### Highlights
- Full conversation history with user prompts and assistant responses with chain of thought reasoning, all run locally.
- Example code snippets generated by the model, demonstrating its ability to create functional code in various programming languages.
